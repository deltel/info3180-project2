# Project 2
Views running, have not tested the api functionality.

Added sir's requires_auth method.

Also added a custom auth decorator. May consider removing it.
Was not sure where to put the auth object, placed it in init.py

Don't know how to use the postman been giving me problems for a while.

## User Details
Decided to add the posts to the response. 
Making a call to the posts api makes sense though, might change it later.
